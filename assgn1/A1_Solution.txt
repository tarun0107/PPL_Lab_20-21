Q.1 How do the declarations look in the GIMPLE? Specifically, what happens to multiple variables declared 
and initialized on the same line? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?
Ans: The variables are declared as usually in simple c program but in case of multiple variable declaration,
variables are declared one by one. In case of global variable, it is not declared as of local variable,
 it is directly used in the expression.

Q.2 How are complex expressions such as [c = a * b + 25] broken down? Can you determine a rule as to when
 temporary variables will be introduced?
Ans: The complex part is broken down into number of steps where operations take place according to their
 precedence and the sub-processed value is stored in temporary variables which are used in further sub-processes.
 Hence the temporaries are introduced to store the value of subexpression of any complex expression.

Q.3 How are floats/doubles represented in GIMPLE? What happens when a float/double is assigned to an integer in [Z = r]?
Ans: Floats and doubles are represented in scientific notations (_e+_) and when float/double is assigned to an
 integer, only its integral part is assigned.

Q.4 How are reads/writes to the global variable Z performed?  Why is there a temporary introduced for the statement
 [Z = Z + 1] but not for the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p]?
Ans: For further arithmetic operation, it may be possible that we have to use a variable declared before. Hence in 
case of Z=Z+1, a temporary is used while in case of statements, its memory is already stored so there is no need of introducing a new temporary.
