Q.1 How many times is the expression (a + c) computed in the original code (as seen in the
SSA pass)? What about after the FRE pass?
Ans: The expression (a + c) got executed two times but in FRE pass, a temporary variable 
saved the value of expression and used the temporary variable next time.

Q.2 Have there been any more optimizations after FRE?  How will you check?
Ans: We can check if there have been any optimization by checking 
 B-4.c.*.optimized which is the final file after optimization. It appears that redundant 
assignment subsequently been eliminated.
 
Q.3 Why did we have to put a "return b" in this assignment?  What if "return b" is changed 
to "return 0"? Will it make any difference?
Ans: Yes, it will make difference in output. As we know, return 0 give control to os and 
hence there will be no output. Instead if we return b, it will give us the value of b computed from program.
