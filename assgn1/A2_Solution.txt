Q.1 How have if-blocks been translated into GIMPLE statements? Can you differentiate between 
conditional and unconditional gotos ?
Ans: The if-blocks are broken down to some sections of code in form of blocks e. g goto <_>. 
For conditional gotos, 1st condition is given then it is directed to go to other blocks e. g. 
if (a == 0) goto <D.3099> and unconditional ones are direct operated.

Q.2 Repeat the above compilation, but now asking for another dump that of the pass "cfg".  
View this pass and say whether this representation makes it easier to read and understand 
GIMPLEs. Draw the control-flow graph of the program A-2.c on a piece of paper by looking at the CFG dump.
Ans: The control flow graph shows some basic blocks <bb> which are numbered from 2 to 6 to make 
the program easier to understand.  
Control flow graph:
  f ()
                {
                  int c;
                  int b;
                  int a;
                  int Z.0;
                  int D.1715;

                <bb 2>:	
                  a = Z;
                  if (a <= 9)
                    goto <bb 3>;
                  else
                    goto <bb 4>;

                <bb 3>:
                  b = 5;
                  c = 17;
                  goto <bb 6>;

                <bb 4>:
                  b = 6;
                  c = 20;
                  if (a == 0)
                    goto <bb 5>;
                  else
                    goto <bb 6>;

                <bb 5>:
                  c = 0;

                <bb 6>:
                  D.1715 = b * 10;
                  Z.0 = D.1715 + c;
                  Z = Z.0;
                  return;
